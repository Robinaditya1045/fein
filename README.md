# Sound-Stake

## Introduction

Welcome to **Sound-Stake**, an Music Staking Platform aims to address these challenges by introducing a decentralized, blockchain-based solution that enables direct interaction between artists and fans. It leverages music staking as a way for fans to invest in music projects and share in the financial success of the artists they support. 
. By leveraging **BASE blockchain technology** Sound-Stake rewards fans/users with tokens.


## Tech Stack

Sound-Stake utilizes a diverse array of technologies to create seamless and engaging user experiences:

- **Nextjs**: A powerful React framework for building server-side rendered applications, facilitating the development of dynamic and SEO-friendly components.
- **Base**: An Ethereum Layer 2 blockchain that provides faster and cheaper transactions while maintaining the security of the Ethereum network.
- **Solidity**: A smart contract programming language used to develop decentralized applications (dApps) on the Ethereum blockchain.
- **Hardhat**: A development environment for compiling, deploying, testing, and debugging smart contracts on Ethereum-based blockchains.
- **Pinata**:  A service for securely managing and sharing files on IPFS, often used for hosting decentralized media or metadata.
- **IPFS**: The InterPlanetary File System, a distributed protocol for storing and sharing files across a decentralized network.
- **PostgreSQL**:A powerful open-source relational database management system used to store and manage application data.
- **Prisma**: An ORM (Object-Relational Mapping) tool used for interacting with PostgreSQL and other databases in a type-safe and efficient way.
- **Vercel**:  A deployment platform optimized for hosting Next.js applications with support for serverless functions, caching, and performance optimization.
- **neon DB**: A managed PostgreSQL solution optimized for serverless computing, offering scalability and high availability for your database needs.


### Key Features

- **Staking for Music Projects**: Fans can stake tokens to support a specific artist or music project, becoming early backers. These tokens then represent their share in the revenue generated through which they can earn on the basis of the songs reach.This allows fans to have a stake in the success of the music they love.

- **Fair Revenue Distribution**: Revenue generated from streams, sales, or other income sources is distributed directly to artists, stakeholders, and fans who have staked in the project. This is done transparently using smart contracts, ensuring that everyone receives their fair share without delays.

- **Artist Empowerment**: Artists maintain creative control and ownership of their work. They can fund their projects by raising capital from their fan base through staking, bypassing traditional gatekeepers like record labels and streaming platforms.
The platform gives artists direct access to their fans, allowing them to build stronger, more engaged communities.

- **Decentralization and Transparency**: Using blockchain technology, the platform offers full transparency into how revenue is generated, distributed, and shared. Smart contracts automatically execute the distribution of funds, eliminating the need for intermediaries.
Both artists and fans can track and verify the flow of funds and staking rewards in realtime.

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
